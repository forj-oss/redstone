# Openstack layout - Version 0.01
#

# This file has been created to be focused for the first generator script to manage openstack as a Blueprint implementation.
#
# On Maestro, this file will need to be located under /usr/lib/maestro/layouts.
# By convention, the layout will be named as <bluePrintName>-layout.yaml to make the distinction against the master one.

# Variables:
# There is at least 3 kind of variables. All of these variables are defined from the blueprint. 
# In the deploy file, we will implement 2 kind of files:
# - hiera variables. We will have a file per servers.
#   runtime_project/files/hiera/hieradata/Debian/nodetype/*.yaml
# - site.pp
#   site.pp will need to be replaced by a collection of files. See http://docs.puppetlabs.com/puppet/latest/reference/dirs_manifest.html
#   Currently, I have updated site.pp to reflect a simplified util section. But this should be stored under a <server>.pp
